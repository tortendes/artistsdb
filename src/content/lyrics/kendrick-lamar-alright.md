<p>Alls my life I has to fight, nigga</p>
<p>Alls my life I</p>
<p>Hard times like, yah!</p>
<p>Bad trips like, yah!</p>
<p>Nazareth, I'm fucked up</p>
<p>Homie, you fucked up</p>
<p>But if God got us then we gon' be alright</p>
<br>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Huh? We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright</p>
<br>
<p>Uh, and when I wake up</p>
<p>I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut</p>
<p>But homicide be looking at you from the face down</p>
<p>What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down</p>
<p>Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life</p>
<p>Painkillers only put me in the twilight</p>
<p>Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight</p>
<p>Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like</p>
<p>Lord knows, twenty of 'em in my Chevy</p>
<p>Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow</p>
<p>So my karma come in heaven, no preliminary hearings on my record</p>
<p>I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh</p>
<p>Tell the world I know it's too late</p>
<p>Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray</p>
<p>Drown inside my vices all day</p>
<p>Won't you please believe when I say</p>
<br>
<p>Wouldn't you know</p>
<p>We been hurt, been down before, nigga</p>
<p>When our pride was low</p>
<p>Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"</p>
<p>And we hate po-po</p>
<p>Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga</p>
<p>I'm at the preacher's door</p>
<p>My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow</p>
<p>But we gon' be alright</p>
<br>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Huh? We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright</p>
<br>
<p>What you want you, a house? You, a car?</p>
<p>40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?</p>
<p>Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog</p>
<p>Motherfucker, you can live at the mall</p>
<p>I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal</p>
<p>I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero</p>
<p>Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal</p>
<p>Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you</p>
<p>Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you</p>
<p>In the presence of your chico ah!</p>
<p>I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool</p>
<p>If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you</p>
<p>Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all</p>
<p>Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all</p>
<p>I rap, I black on track so rest assured</p>
<p>My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God</p>
<br>
<p>Wouldn't you know</p>
<p>We been hurt, been down before, nigga</p>
<p>When our pride was low</p>
<p>Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"</p>
<p>And we hate po-po</p>
<p>Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga</p>
<p>I'm at the preacher's door</p>
<p>My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow</p>
<p>But we gon' be alright</p>
<br>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Huh? We gon' be alright</p>
<p>Nigga, we gon' be alright</p>
<p>Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright</p>
<br>
<p>I keep my head up high</p>
<p>I cross my heart and hope to die</p>
<p>Lovin' me is complicated</p>
<p>Too afraid of a lot of changes</p>
<p>I'm alright and you're a favorite</p>
<p>Dark nights in my prayers</p>
<br>
<p>I remembered you was conflicted</p>
<p>Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same</p>
<p>Abusing my power full of resentment</p>
<p>Resentment that turned into a deep depression</p>
<p>Found myself screamin' in the hotel room</p>
<p>I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me</p>
<p>So I went runnin' for answers</p>
