<p>Lift your head, baby, don't be scared</p>
<p>Of the things that could go wrong along the way</p>
<p>You'll get by with a smile</p>
<p>You can't win at everything but you can try.</p>
<br>
<p>Baby, you don't have to worry</p>
<p>'Coz there ain't no need to hurry</p>
<p>No one ever said that there's an easy way</p>
<p>When they're closing all their doors</p>
<p>And they don't want you anymore</p>
<p>This sounds funny but I'll say it anyway.</p>
<br>
<p>Girl I'll stay through the bad times</p>
<p>Even if I have to fetch you everyday</p>
<p>You'll get by with a smile</p>
<p>You can never be too happy in this life.</p>
<br>
<p>In a world where everybody</p>
<p>Hates a happy ending story</p>
<p>It's the one you love can make the world go round</p>
<p>But dont let it bring you down</p>
<p>And turn your face into a frown</p>
<p>You'll get along with a little prayer and a song.</p>
<br>
<p>(Too doo doo doo...)</p>
<p>Let me hear you sing it</p>
<p>(Too doo doo doo...)</p>
<br>
<p>In a world where everybody</p>
<p>Hates a happy ending story</p>
<p>It's a wonder love can make the world go round</p>
<p>But don't let it bring you down</p>
<p>And turn your face into a frown</p>
<p>You'll get along with a little prayer and a song.</p>
<br>
<p>Lift your head, baby, don't be scared</p>
<p>Of the things that could go wrong along the way</p>
<p>You'll get by with a smile</p>
<p>Now it's time to kiss away those tears goodbye</p>
<br>
<p>(Too doo doo doo...)</p>
<p>Let me hear you sing it</p>
<p>(Too doo doo doo...)</p>
