<p>I'm so cold, I'm so grown, I'm so real life</p>
<p>I'm so show-off my diamonds designed to twinkle and bleed light</p>
<p>As the valley fills with darkness, shadows chase and run around</p>
<p>I can make them stop for me - and no lamb, no savior's shelter</p>
<p>I'll be better off alone, I'll walk at my own pace</p>
<p>I don't need no one, I've got my own, I've got it made</p>
<p>In the morning I cheer for sunshine and I feel, but I don't feel enough</p>
<p>In the midnight hours I try to</p>
<br>
<p>Then you show me, now I believe</p>
<p>Diamonds and dreams come true for girls like me</p>
<br>
<p>Now I feel in love, babe</p>
<p>I really know that your love is enough</p>
<p>And I'm so lucky you found me in the day I needed love</p>
<p>Now I feel in love, babe, everywhere you are</p>
<br>
<p>Your dude came to rock for me, hot body, yes, I got it, got it</p>
<p>All of the girls are dance floor queens until I put my Blahniks on it</p>
<p>Move and make it hot for me, hot rod, oh yes, I'll ride it, ride it</p>
<p>Dance for me, get naughty, he wild out for these expensive options</p>
<br>
<p>You know the glow stuntin' in front row</p>
<p>Shades always, these bitches can't look, no</p>
<p>Bob sleek-chic petite, I fit those</p>
<p>En Vogue, I do what you can't know</p>
<p>I'm runway, you know they a side show</p>
<p>I'm first page, the mainstage as I pose</p>
<p>The one dame, the one name that y'all know</p>
<p>Just take notes, stay on top like halos</p>
<p>Make pesos, most of these bitches is my clones</p>
<p>You new puss, this catwalk is my throne</p>
<p>I'm penthouse, you're trap house and rhinestones</p>
<p>These diamonds on my bones be my own</p>
<p>Invent styles, I been crowned, this my home</p>
<p>Bitch, I'm grown in ballgowns - it's french sewn</p>
<p>You take shots, I make shots, the end zone</p>
<p>These bitches overall is some Laura's they Winslow</p>
<br>
<p>Then you show me, now I believe</p>
<p>Diamonds and dreams come true for girls like me</p>
<br>
<p>Now I feel in love, babe</p>
<p>I really know that your love is enough</p>
<p>And I'm so lucky you found me in the day I needed love</p>
<p>Now I feel in love, babe, everywhere you are</p>
