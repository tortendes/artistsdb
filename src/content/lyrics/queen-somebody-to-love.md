<p>Can</p>
<p>Anybody find me</p>
<p>Somebody to love?</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh</p>
<br>
<p>Each morning I get up I die a little</p>
<p>Can barely stand on my feet (Take a look at yourself)</p>
<p>Take a look in the mirror and cry (in the mirror and cry)</p>
<p>Lord, what you're doing to me? (Yeah, yeah)</p>

<p>I have spent all my years in believing you (believing you)</p>

<br>
<p>I work hard (He works hard)</p>
<p>Every day of my life</p>
<p>I work 'til I ache in my bones</p>
<p>At the end (At the end of the day)</p>
<p>I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own (Goes home, goes home on his own)</p>
<br>
<p>I get down (down) on my knees (knees) and I start to pray</p>
<p>'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord!</p>
<br>
<p>Somebody (somebody)</p>
<p>Ooh, somebody</p>
<p>Can anybody find me</p>
<p>Somebody to love?</p>

<p>I try, and I try, and I try</p>
<p>But everybody wants to put me down</p>
<p>They say I'm going crazy</p>
<p>They say I got a lot of water in my brain</p>
<p>Ah, I got no common sense</p>
<p>He's got nobody left to believe in</p>
<p>(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</p>
<br>
<p>Ooh somebody, ooh (somebody)</p>
<p>Anybody find me</p>
<p>Somebody to love? (Can anybody find me someone to love?)</p>

<p>Got no feel, I got no rhythm</p>
<p>I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing and losing)</p>
<p>I'm okay, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright)</p>
<p>I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)</p>
<p>I just gotta get out of this prison cell</p>
<p>Some day (one day) I'm gonna be free, Lord!</p>
