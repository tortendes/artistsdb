<p>When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me</p>
<p>Speaking words of wisdom, let it be</p>
<p>And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me</p>
<p>Speaking words of wisdom, let it be</p>
<br>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Whisper words of wisdom</p>
<p>Let it be</p>
<br>
<p>And when the broken-hearted people living in the world agree</p>
<p>There will be an answer, let it be</p>
<p>For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see</p>
<p>There will be an answer, let it be</p>
<br>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Yeah, there will be an answer</p>
<p>Let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Whisper words of wisdom</p>
<p>Let it be</p>
<br>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, yeah, let it be</p>
<p>Whisper words of wisdom</p>
<p>Let it be</p>
<br>
<p>And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me</p>
<p>Shine until tomorrow, let it be</p>
<p>I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me</p>
<p>Speaking words of wisdom, let it be</p>
<br>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, yeah, let it be</p>
<p>There will be an answer</p>
<p>Let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, yeah, let it be</p>
<p>There will be an answer</p>
<p>Let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, let it be</p>
<p>Let it be, yeah, let it be</p>
<p>Whisper words of wisdom</p>
<p>Let it be</p>
