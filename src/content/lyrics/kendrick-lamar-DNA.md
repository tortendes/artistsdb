<p>I got, I got, I got, I got</p>
<p>Loyalty, got royalty</p>
<p>Inside my DNA</p>
<p>Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace</p>
<p>Inside my DNA</p>
<p>I got power, poison, pain and joy</p>
<p>Inside my DNA</p>
<p>I got hustle, though, ambition, flow</p>
<p>Inside my DNA</p>
<br>
<p>I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception</p>
<p>I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua's new weapon</p>
<p>I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head</p>
<p>This that put-the-kids-to-bed, this that</p>
<br>
<p>I got, I got, I got, I got</p>
<p>Realness, I just kill shit</p>
<p>'Cause it's in my DNA</p>
<p>I got millions, I got riches</p>
<p>Buildin' in my DNA</p>
<p>I got dark, I got evil, that rot</p>
<p>Inside my DNA</p>
<p>I got off, I got troublesome heart</p>
<p>Inside my DNA</p>
<br>
<p>I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve</p>
<p>Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird</p>
<p>You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard</p>
<p>I know how you work, I know just who you are</p>
<p>See, you's a, you's a, you's a bitch</p>
<br>
<p>Your hormones prolly switch</p>
<p>Inside your DNA</p>
<p>Problem is, all that sucker shit</p>
<p>Inside your DNA</p>
<p>Daddy prolly snitched, heritage</p>
<p>Inside your DNA</p>
<p>Backbone don't exist</p>
<p>Born onside a jellyfish, I gauge</p>
<br>
<p>See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front</p>
<p>Shit I've been through prolly offend you</p>
<p>This is Paula's oldest son</p>
<p>I know murder, conviction</p>
<p>Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption</p>
<p>Scholars, fathers dead with kids</p>
<p>And I wish I was fed forgiveness</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA</p>
<p>Born inside the beast</p>
<p>My expertise checked out in second grade</p>
<p>When I was nine, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay</p>
<p>At twenty-nine, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate</p>
<p>And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to antisocial, extrovert</p>
<p>And excellent mean the extra work</p>
<p>And absent-ness what the fuck you heard</p>
<p>And pessimists never struck my nerve</p>
<p>And that's a riff, gonna plead this case</p>
<p>The reason my power's here on earth</p>
<p>Salute the truth, when the prophet say</p>
<br>
<p>I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA</p>
<p>(This is why I say that Hip-Hop has done more damage)</p>
<p>(To young African-Americans than racism in recent years)</p>
<p>I live a better, fuck your life</p>
<p>(Five, four, three, two, one) this is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'</p>
<p>Money and power, the makin' of marriages</p>
<br>
<p>Tell me somethin'</p>
<p>You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'</p>
<p>I'd rather die than to listen to you</p>
<p>My DNA not for imitation</p>
<p>Your DNA an abomination</p>
<p>This how it is when you're in the Matrix</p>
<p>Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow</p>
<p>And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go</p>
<p>And sleepin' in a Villa</p>
<p>Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'</p>
<p>Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors</p>
<p>Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window</p>
<p>Baby in the pool, Godfather goals, only Lord knows</p>
<br>
<p>I've been goin' hammer, dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras</p>
<p>Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals</p>
<p>Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana</p>
<p>Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes</p>
<p>Phone never on, I don't conversate</p>
<p>I don't compromise, I just penetrate</p>
<p>Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks</p>
<p>These are the times, level number nine</p>
<p>Look up in the sky, ten is on the way</p>
<p>Sentence on the way, killings on the way</p>
<p>Motherfucker, I got winners on the way</p>
<br>
<p>You ain't shit without a body on your belt</p>
<p>You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate</p>
<p>You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself</p>
<p>You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate</p>
<p>Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate</p>
<p>Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith</p>
<p>Peace to the world, let it rotate</p>
<p>Sex, money, murder, our DNA</p>
