<p>Is this the real life?</p>
<p>Is this just fantasy?</p>
<p>Caught in a landslide</p>
<p>No escape from reality</p>
<p>Open your eyes</p>
<p>Look up to the skies and see</p>
<p>I'm just a poor boy</p>
<p>I need no sympathy</p>
<p>Because I'm easy come, easy go</p>
<p>Little high, little low</p>
<p>Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me</p>
<br>
<p>Mama, just killed a man</p>
<p>Put a gun against his head</p>
<p>Pulled my trigger, now he's dead</p>
<p>Mama, life had just begun</p>
<p>But now I've gone and thrown it all away</p>
<p>Mama, ooh</p>
<p>Didn't mean to make you cry</p>
<p>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow</p>
<p>Carry on, carry on</p>
<p>As if nothing really matters</p>
<br>
<p>Too late, my time has come</p>
<p>Sends shivers down my spine</p>
<p>Body's aching all the time</p>
<p>Goodbye everybody, I've got to go</p>
<p>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth</p>
<p>Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)</p>
<p>I don't wanna die</p>
<p>I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all</p>
<br>
<p>I see a little silhouetto of a man</p>
<p>Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?</p>
<p>Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me</p>
<p>Gallileo, Gallileo</p>
<p>Gallileo, Gallileo</p>
<p>Gallileo Figaro, magnifico</p>
<p>I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me</p>
<p>He's just a poor boy from a poor family</p>
<p>Spare him his life from this monstrosity</p>
<p>Easy come easy go, will you let me go?</p>
<p>Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (let him go)</p>
<p>Bismillah! We will not let you go (let him go)</p>
<p>Bismillah! We will not let you go (let me go)</p>
<p>Will not let you go (let me go)</p>
<p>Never, never, never, never let me go</p>
<p>No, no, no, no, no, no, no</p>
<p>Oh, mama mia, mama mia</p>
<p>Mama mia, let me go</p>
<p>Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me</p>
<p>For me</p>
<p>For me</p>
<br>
<p>So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?</p>
<p>So you think you can love me and leave me to die?</p>
<p>Oh, baby</p>
<p>Can't do this to me, baby</p>
<p>Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here</p>
<br>
<p>(Ooh)</p>
<p>(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)</p>
<br>
<p>Nothing really matters</p>
<p>Anyone can see</p>
<p>Nothing really matters</p>
<p>Nothing really matters to me</p>
<br>
<p>Any way the wind blows</p>
