<p>It took one look</p>
<p>Then forever laid out in front of me</p>
<p>One smile, then I died</p>
<p>Only to be revived by you</p>
<br>
<p>There I was</p>
<p>Thought I had everything figured out</p>
<p>Goes to show just how much I know</p>
<p>'Bout the way life plays out</p>
<br>
<p>I take one step away</p>
<p>Then I find myself coming back to you</p>
<p>My one and only</p>
<p>One and only you</p>
<p>Ooh-ooh-ooh</p>
<br>
<p>Now I know</p>
<p>That I know not a thing at all</p>
<p>Except the fact that I am yours</p>
<p>And that you are mine</p>
<br>
<p>Oh-oh</p>
<p>That they told me that this wouldn't be easy</p>
<p>And no</p>
<p>I'm not one to complain</p>
<br>
<p>I take one step away</p>
<p>Then I find myself coming back to you</p>
<p>My one and only</p>
<p>One and only</p>
<p>I take one step away</p>
<p>Then I find myself coming back to you</p>
<p>My one and only</p>
<p>One and only you</p>
